Doughnuts? Bagels? Loopy churros? Regardless, the 12 ringy thingy's pictured
here all the same variations of the same base torus and using the same
4D noise space, with various tweaks to the noise coefficients
and the points at which the space is sampled from. The noise itself is sampled
from the cartesian product of two circles, which happens to work out nicely
to a 4d torus. It's doughnuts all the way down!
