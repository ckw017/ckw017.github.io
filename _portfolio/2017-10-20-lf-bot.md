An email bot that notifies the user whenever new items have been added to the UC Berkeley Lost and Found. Up-to-date data is synced with a Firebase database, and displayed on the [interative webpage](https://ckw017.github.io/berkeley-lf-page/). Currently being run off of [OCF infrastructure](https://ocf.io). In loving memory of the pair of glasses that I lost during orientation week :'(
