A two-stage pipelined CPU that runs the [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) instruction set (thanks [David Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Patterson_(computer_scientist))!). This was actually a real
doozy that would take a while to list out but in summary:

* Full Arithmetic Logic Unit built from ground-up with logic gates
    * Including support for word, half-word, and byte level instructions
* Memory, branching, and instruction decoding
* 2-stage (instruction-fetch, execute) pipelining
    * And cases for all the wonderful side-effects that crop out in conjunction with branching :' )
* Lifetime supply of unit and integration tests
