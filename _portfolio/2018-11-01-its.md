Worked in the [Transportation Sustainability Research Center](https://tsrc.berkeley.edu/) on
data collection and APIs for two main projects:

* [American Truck Parking](http://www.americantruckparking.com/) is a real-time parking database
for long haul truckers along major U.S. highways. I automated some of the data entry tasks and added
dynamic parking updates for â‰ˆ100 new parking locations. If you're interested in policy
[this story](https://truckertotrucker.com/blog/jasons-law/) explains the motivation for this project.

* The [Mobility Data Specification](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification)
is trying to standardize an API for "dockless" bikes and scooters as an extension of the
[General Bikeshare Feed Specification](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs). I worked on archiving data from
these public feeds tracking the movements of over 10,000 shared vehicles in the U.S. and Europe
