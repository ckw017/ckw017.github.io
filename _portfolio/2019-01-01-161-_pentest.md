A close contender for my favorite security project, however since it mainly
consisted of breaking things instead of building I hesitate to list this at
the top. I was handed an insecure webserver and was tasked to find
7 exploits. To chain each exploit more effectively I ended up writing a few
tools in Python to automate generating and sending malicious payloads.

I can't really list what the exploits were publicly since this project is still
in use by the course, but they're listed out in the private repo along with
the tools.
