Title is a mouthful but that's what it was officially labeled as! In addition to being
a programming assignment this was a major exercise in secure design,
so the source also includes a design
document detailing the possible attack vectors and appropriate defenses. In particular
the system was designed to allow trusted users to share files with each other using a client
and an insecure data server. The goal was to allow
for client's to share arbitrarily large files, update + revoke access privileges, and modify files
in such a way that it would be computationally infeasible for an attacker to recover
information, modify a file silently, or impersonate another user even with full control
over the storage server.

Implementation relies on traditional RSA, Argon2 for key derivation + password hashing, and generous
applications of HMAC. Sadly still vulnerable to Rubber-hose Cryptanalysis.
