CS170 (Algorithms) at Berkeley has a long tradition of handing students an NP-complete
problem and holding a competition to see who can produce the best
computationally tractable approximation. [Guavabot](https://www.dailycal.org/2019/10/14/clog-report-15-of-uc-berkeley-students-actually-3-stacked-kiwibots-in-trench-coat/) rescue gave a two layered
problem:
* Faulty sensing
* Steiner-tree approximation

Team "```go-bears'; UPDATE Teams SET score = 0 WHERE name != 'go-bears';```" got rank 23 out of
320 groups. The important thing, of course, was that countless stranded Guavabots around the world were rescued.

As with other projects I can't really reveal my group's approach publicly since this project
may resurface in future semesters, but if you're 1) curious and 2) not planning to enroll then
let me know!
