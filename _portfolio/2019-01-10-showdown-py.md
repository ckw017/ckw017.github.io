A [Pokemon Showdown!](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) client for Python 3.4 and 3.5. This was written to make it easier to write bots, interact with users, moderate chat rooms, and collect data. Takes advantages of Py3's async features to allow multiple connections over websockets, maintain IO channels, and to integrate with existing IRC bots.
