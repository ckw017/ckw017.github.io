I interned with Berkeley's advanced transportation group [PATH](https://path.berkeley.edu/about) on their
[integrated dynamic transit operations](https://path.berkeley.edu/research/connected-and-automated-vehicles/integrated-dynamic-transit-operation-idto-system-using)
project, which is currently partnering with BART and Alameda County to support enhanced
transit operations including dynamic routing, ridesharing, and strategic dispatch. I worked
on the interface for driver's to receive and manage requests and the associated backend
components to log responses and synchronize with dispatchers.

Summary:
* Designed and built flexible user interface for bus drivers to view and manage requests from potential passengers and affiliated transit agencies for dynamic routing
* Integrated IoT input devices with onboard display device and server to create physical interface for operators
