I interned at the career service company [BOLD](https://www.bold.com/) over the summer
of 2019. This job was a really nice extension of some of the embedding projects I was
doing earlier in the year for research and it was great to see the technique cropping on in
an industry application!

Summary
* Built backend of semantic search and recommendation system for LiveCareer's job matching service, incorporated into data pipeline
* Worked closely with data science team to build set of offline evaluation measures for information retrieval
* Benchmarked new system against existing one, verified improved relevance and ~80% reduction in preprocessing time
