Built up handful of handy features from a bare bones (single-process, almost no syscalls) operating system.

* Implemented userspace
    * Processes, threads, page faults, and appropriate syscalls
* Implemented thread priority
    * Scheduling, timers, deadlock avoidance in synchronization primitives
* Implemented a file system
    * Inodes, path resolution, caching, and appropriate syscalls

For prospective students: this class is fun, but fun and difficult aren't mutually exclusive.
