*Currently in progress~*

Building up features from a bare bones operating system! I'll come back to write a more detailed
report but so far it's been:

* Implementing userspace 
    * Processes, threads, page faults, and appropriate syscalls
* Implementing thread priority
    * MLFQS, timers, deadlock avoidance in synchronization primitives
* Implementing a file system
    * Inodes, syscalls, path resolution, caching, and appropriate syscalls

For prospective students: this class is fun! But fun isn't mutually exclusive from hard : )
