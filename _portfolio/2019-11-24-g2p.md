Grapheme to phoneme alignments for the Carnegie Melon's pronouncing dictionary
data set. Alignments were produced using [Phonetisaurus](https://github.com/AdolfVonKleist/Phonetisaurus). I couldn't find an open version of the most recent set of alignments anywhere, so I produced this to save some other people some time.

A grapheme to phoneme alignment maps letters (graphemes) to their sounds when spoken (phonemes). For example the graphemes `H,E,LL,O` get aligned to the sounds `HH,EH0,L,OW1` where the sounds are represented using [ARPAbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET) notation.
