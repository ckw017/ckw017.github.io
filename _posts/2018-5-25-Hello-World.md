Hello world! I just finished my first year at university, and I thought it would be neat to share some of the projects I undertook throughout the year somewhere, both personal and for classes. If you're interested in anything you see or have any feedback, feel free to contact me at [chriswong21@berkeley.edu](mailto:chriswong21@berkeley.edu).
