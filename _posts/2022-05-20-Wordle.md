DRAFT, because local dev environments on arch linux break really frequently

Wordle: the [2048](https://play2048.co/) of 2022. The first like, 2 months of it anyway. I probably should have written this while it was still trendy, but better late than never!

# Optimistic Optimality Opinions

I'm just going to assume you already know what Wordle is. But what is optimal Wordle? It turns out this is a really tricky topic:
* Early in the year lots of posts started appearing on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com) about supposedly [optimal Wordle](https://towardsdatascience.com/optimal-wordle-d8c2f2805704) strategies. Many of these weren't really optimal in any rigorous sense, they just used neat heuristics based on letter distributions.
* Lots of debate was sparked over what it actually meant for a strategy to be optimal. Is it cheating to use the [secret list](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-list/wordle-word-list) of all the possible answers? Is any strategy that gets every word in 6 tries optimal? Should it minimize the expected values of guesses needed? Or minimize the maximum number of guesses needed? What about hard mode?
* Lots of debate about if debating about what optimal Wordle looks like ruins the point of Wordle

One surprising event in all of this was when the popular math educator 3Blue1Brown uploaded a video titled "The mathematically optimal Wordle strategy", which was retitled a few days later to [Solving Wordle using information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) when bugs in the original implementation were found, and stronger definitions of "mathematically optimal" were considered. This isn't meant to be a knock at 3B1B but rather an example of how tricky it is to get the definition right. In particular, the 3B1B video used a *very* effective heuristic to generate the decision tree, but at the end of the day heuristics aren't the real optimization criteria.

For actual optimality results, Laurent Porrier compiled a [list of all the Wordle optimality results so far](https://www.poirrier.ca/notes/wordle-optimal/) which is still being actively updated as of May 18th!

# If there's already a big list of a bunch of optimality results then whats the point of this article?
