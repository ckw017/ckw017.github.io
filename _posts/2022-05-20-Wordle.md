DRAFT, because local dev environments on arch linux break really frequently

Wordle: the [2048](https://play2048.co/) of [2022](https://oeis.org/search?q=2022&language=english&go=Search). The first 2 months of it anyway. I probably should have written this while it was still trendy, but better late than never!

# Optimistic Optimality Opinions

I'm just going to assume you already know what Wordle is. But what is optimal Wordle? It turns out this is a really tricky topic:
* Early in the year lots of posts started appearing on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com) about supposedly [optimal Wordle](https://towardsdatascience.com/optimal-wordle-d8c2f2805704) strategies. Many of these weren't really optimal in a rigorous sense, they just used neat heuristics based on letter distributions.
* Lots of debate was sparked over what it actually meant for a strategy to be optimal. Is it cheating to use the [secret list](https://www.wordunscrambler.net/word-list/wordle-word-list) of possible answers? Should we minize the expected value of guesses needed? Or minimize the maximum number of guesses needed? What about hard mode?
* Lots of debate about if debating about optimal Wordle ruins the point of Wordle.

One surprising event in all of this was when the popular math educator [3Blue1Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Blue1Brown) uploaded an ambitiously titled video:

 This was retitled a few days later to [Solving Wordle using information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) when bugs in the original implementation were found, and stronger definitions of "mathematically optimal" were considered. This isn't meant to be a knock at 3B1B but rather an example of how tricky it is to get the definition right. In particular, the 3B1B video used a *very* effective heuristic to generate the decision tree, but at the end of the day heuristics aren't the real optimization criteria.

For real optimality results, Laurent Porrier compiled a [list of all the Wordle optimality results so far](https://www.poirrier.ca/notes/wordle-optimal/) which is still being actively updated as of when this is being written!

# Fun and profit

While scrolling through the comments of one of the many inaptly titled optimal Wordle posts I spotted [a comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29928263#29928609) by [Colin Saunders](https://github.com/colinmsaunders/) promoting a competition for Wordle bot implementations. This piqued my interest, although not because of the Wordle aspect.

A bit of background: long, long ago in the ancient time known as last year, I was [a TA for a programming class](/2021/07/02/Teaching/). One of my jobs was to work on the autograder for student submitted code. One big caveat with autograder's is that you'll inevitably end up having to run arbitrary code in order to submit. Running arbitrary code from (for lack of better characterization) potentially adversarial students does require careful handling. Anyway, my favorite part of the job was getting to do pentesting on our grading infrastructure.
