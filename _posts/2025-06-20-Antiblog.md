The word "antiblog" has been bouncing around my head like a DVD logo for a while.
It popped into my mind a few years ago when I was trying to think of reasons to do more writing,
which naturally lead to thinking of reasons not to do more writing instead.[^1] Anecdotally,
if you look at the three things preceding this writeup a little story forms
about how much I avoid writing:

*The metanarrative of someone who did a bit of writing, zoned out for a year, briefly acknowledged it,*
*disappeared for another four years, then broke hiatus with a writeup they'd been putting off for over a decade.*

I initially imagined an antiblog as a digital version of [hostile architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_architecture)
that intentionally degrades UX to better suit what I wanted to convey in the piece and
make sure it would only reach the audience I had in mind.
We'll get into these ideas more later, but at the time they didn't really feel like they
worked as a definition for "antiblog" since they were just quirky features that
could be layered on top of the traditional blog experience. A good definition finally came
to me when I read about [tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku)
and subsequently [antilibraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilibrary):

> An **antilibrary** is a collection of books that are owned but have not yet been read.

Which we can adapt for our own purposes to get:

> An **antiblog** is a collection of writing that someone has considered publishing to a blog but has not published.

There's something really fun about defining something in terms of how it doesn't totally
exist. Before reading further I invite you to pause here and think about what your personal antiblog
looks like. Is there anything you've encountered or introspections you've had that you've
considered wrtiing about publicly, but haven't followed through on? And what's keeping
you from it? If you have written about things, what are you choosing to leave out or backspacing
into the void before publishing? Jazz is the notes you *don't* play after all.

One way to get a more structured view of what an antiblog is to imagine how your own "headspace" is structured,
i.e. the collection comprised of all of your thoughts, ideas, and memories. To help get a feel for it we can think about where
thoughts sit along various axes:
* Simple vs. Complex
* Niche vs. Universal
* Personal vs. Impersonal
* Insightful vs. Uninsightful
* Funny vs. Serious
* etc...

Using these axes we can try to visualize[^2] examples of how thoughts might manifest
outside of "thoughtspace" as different forms of writing and communication.

These visualizations are based roughly on the structure of my own thoughts and communication
style. For example, at the moment my blog is almost entirely "impersonal" thoughts on technical subjects
a la the site's tagline "Computer stuff and things tangentially related to computer stuff."[^3]
For some people it might skew more towards personal or be "multimodal" and centered around
both personal and impersonal thoughts, or for the average person would simply be blank.
Although not shown here, you can think of the "density" in terms of number of thoughts in
different parts of the space as a summary of your thought patterns, while the "density" of
instances of communication as a summary of your communication style. If you're in an introspective
mood you can play around with how your own headspace mapping looks and consider how
it relates to your own thought patterns, communication style, and the interplay between the two.

<!--

Most of my writing employs a nonchalant, sometimes irreverent, sometimes overly sarcastic,
sometimes silly tone because I have a hard time taking people who take themselves too seriously seriously.

**Warning**: Excessive use of footnotes[^1] and metatextual[^2] elements.

I'm sure there are many sane
ways to get over this kind of writer's block, but rather than considering any of them I
thought about funky ways to make readers jump through hoops instead.The reasoning
followed the lines of:
* I want to publish something but I'm worried what'll happen once its out in the wild.
* But if I never publish it, then no one will ever read it![^4]
* Maybe I can find some kind of middle ground between published and unpublished by messing
with the reader.roughly

I initially imagined an antiblog as a digital
version of [hostile architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_architecture) that
intentionally degrades the ergonomics of traditional blog formats to better fit what I wanted to cover:
* Pop-ups that force the user to click through an inconvenient amount of "Accept/Decline"
prompts giving reasons not to take the piece too seriously before loading it.
* Using fonts that intentionally render letters as the wrong character and undoing
the permutation in the raw text so that it displays correctly. This would make things human
readable on the site, but screws with webscrapers (i.e. indexers, LLM data harvesters,
automated DMCA claims) and anyone trying to copy text and paste it elsewhere.
* Leaving the majority of posts out of any central index, forcing users
to organically encounter links within indexed articles to find unindexed ones or solve
a puzzle[^5] to jump straight to the url from their browser.
* Write-ups where the title remains the same, but different versions of the body are served
depending on some arbitrary value tied to each user (some function of their IP).
Conversations about the piece that take place on external sites (Hacker News, Reddit,
etc...) would consist of people talking past eachother as they discuss completely
different takes on the same topic.[^6]

Each of these ideas[^7] definitely felt "antibloggy" in their own right, although it was hard
to come up with a tidy definition that captured all of them beyond "actively hostile web design."
A good definition finally came to me when I read about [tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku)
and stumbled across [antilibraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilibrary):

> An **antilibrary** is a collection of books that are owned but have not yet been read.

Which we can adapt for our own purposes to get:

> An **antiblog** is a collection of blog posts that someone has considered writing or publishing but have not been published.

We'll get into how this definition ties into the "hostile architecture" list from earlier, but before
we do that it might help to think about the "space of writing" and how this definition
would fit into it. We can start by seeing how it relates to the [blogosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere)
(the space of all blogs).

### Footnotes

[^1]: I recently found out markdown supports footnotes!

[^2]:
    The intended way to read this post is to ignore all the footnotes after this one
    until you reach the end, and then go back through them if you feel like it.

[^3]:
    A skill I picked up from work is to approach problems by thinking of all the ways
    things can go wrong. This is a useful mindset for building distributed systems and
    hitting uptime goals, but a pretty terrible mindset for living your life.

[^4]: This is kind of like a very low stakes version of the [Hedgehog's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog%27s_dilemma)

[^5]: For example, determine the value of the `<shibboleth>` for something like <br>`https://chriskw.xyz/puzzle/<shibboleth>`.

[^6]:
    If you really want plausible deniability for whatever reason, you could mix in
    one "real" copy of the piece with several LLM generated copies, and leave it up to the readers
    to figure out which one reflects what you actually want to say.


Since the definition is pretty broad we can break it down into a few subcategories, going roughly
from "fine" to "coarse" grain:
* Cutting room floor. These are all the bits and pieces that are cut from *within* a piece before
  publishing.
    * At the smallest scale, I usually check
      that I've removed completely unnecessary instances of the word "that", like the two that
      show up in this sentence.
    * The next biggest category for me is comprised of self-indulgent jokes or phrases that can't be
      shoehorned in smoothly. For example, I was looking for a place to use the phrase
      "a cage went in search of a bird" in an earlier draft but couldn't find a place
      to fit it in thematically.
    * The largest cuts are usually fun tangents or overly involved analogies which,
      while interesting in their own right would, derail the main topic. I recently started
      growing a tomato plant on my window sill and learned about pruning [suckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_shoot).
      Many people prune suckers since they use up energy that could
      otherwise go towards growing the main stem or fruits. In many species they can even
      be replanted in a different patch of soil where they can sprout their own
      root system and function as an independent plant.
      In a similar sense one might want to relocate[^2] long analogies or tangents that would
      otherwise divert attention away from the main point of the piece and cause abrupt
      context switches in the flow of the writing.
* Rough drafts and works in progress.
    * I have ~80% of a writeup on how I won an adhoc [Wordle competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121234509/https://botfights.io/event/botfights_i) that's been
      sitting in rough draft purgatory for three years. The failure mode here is that there's
      technical stuff I want to visualize, but crafting examples and making good visuals
      (at least to the standard of quality I made up for myself) lead to an 80/20 rule
      situation.
    * I have a pile of mental rough drafts that I know would work well as blog writeups
      but I just haven't hit the activation energy to start turning into real rough drafts.
* Impedance mismatch between blog format and what you want to write about.
    * A similar problem to "This meeting could have been an email, and that email could have been a slack message"
    *

### Notes

[^1]:
    A skill I picked up from work is to approach problems by thinking of all the ways
    things can go wrong. This is a useful mindset for building distributed systems and
    hitting uptime goals, but a pretty terrible mindset for living your life.

[^2]:
    After the previous writeup I tried to pick a topic as far away from math as possible and
    somehow ended up needing to visualize higher dimensional space again.

[^3]:
    To satisfy the "tangentially related to computer stuff part" for this writeup, it
    might be insightful to think about what forms of communication LLMs are currently being trained
    on and what part of "headspace" you would expect them to come from.
