              <p>For those unfamiliar with the finer details of competitive Pokemon, it’s basically just a fancy version of rock, paper, scissors. While RPS gives each player 3 options, a turn in pokemon consists of around 4-9 possibilities for each player. Each player then reveals his or her choice simultaneously, and the results of their actions play out. This makes it different than games like Tic Tac Toe, Chess, or Go where only one player is “in control” at a time, and instead more like a game of Poker where two players are forced to reveal their hands at the same time.</p>

              <p>While the previous class related post was on the first project of CS61A, this is skipping straight to the second project of CS61B. There were 4 or 5 projects in between the two, but my main problem with them was that for the most part they were nothing more than fancy fill in the blank exercises. This project changed up that format by giving a ton of freedom to the students in terms of implementation.</p>

              <p>Picking up where we left off from Part 1, so far we’ve found a way to generate an optimal strategy
for the game of Hog by recursively calculating which moves would be the best. While effective, it certainly
wouldn’t have made for much of a contest if everyone who came up with this approach were tied for first.
Luckily, the professor was likely aware of this possibility, and threw a wrench into the probabilistic
method by forcing the strategies to work with <em>incomplete information.</em></p>

              <p>The first project of my first CS class at Berkeley was to write the logic for a modified version of the dice game
<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa17/proj/hog/">Hog</a>. The game itself is pretty simple (roll die to score points, first to 100 wins),
and the project was more a less just a warm-up to get everyone used to Python syntax and higher order functions. The extra credit option,
however, was a bit more interesting.</p>
