Hi! I have been a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley since 2017, currently considering a double major in Data Science. I'm currently working in the Haas Neuroeconomics Lab to build [stereotype models](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/39/9696) from word embeddings. I'm also involved with the Transportation Sustainability Research Center/Caltrans doing various backend tasks for their ongoing [truckparking database project](http://www.americantruckparking.com/about-us).

More recently, I've been interning at [BOLD](https://www.bold.com/) on their document retrieval system and managing a fleet a buses with [Berkeley PATH](https://path.berkeley.edu/)'s [T-Connect project](https://path.berkeley.edu/research/connected-and-automated-vehicles/integrated-dynamic-transit-operation-idto-system-using). 

In my (ever dwindling) freetime, I enjoy remaking retro games, reading (currently churning through the DiscWorld series), competitive Pokemon.

If you have any questions/critiques/feedback for me, feel free to contact me!
