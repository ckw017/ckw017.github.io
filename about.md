Hi! I have been a student at UC Berkeley since 2017, doubling in Computer Science and Data Science. I'm currently working in the Haas Neuroeconomics Lab to build [stereotype models](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/39/9696) from word embeddings. I'm also involved with the Institue of Transportation Studies/Caltrans doing various backend tasks for their ongoing [truckparking database project](http://www.americantruckparking.com/about-us).

Next semester I'll be starting as a student instructor for CS186: Databases.

Over the summer I interned [BOLD](https://www.bold.com/) to work on their document retrieval system and helped manage a fleet a buses with [Berkeley PATH](https://path.berkeley.edu/)'s [T-Connect project](https://path.berkeley.edu/research/connected-and-automated-vehicles/integrated-dynamic-transit-operation-idto-system-using). 

In my (ever dwindling) freetime, I enjoy remaking retro games, reading (Vonnegut, Egan, Pratchett),  and playing competitive Pokemon.

If you have any questions/critiques/feedback for me, feel free to contact me!
