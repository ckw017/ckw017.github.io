Hi! I have been a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley since 2017, currently considering a double major in Data Science. I'm currently working in the Haas Neuroeconomics Lab to build [stereotype models](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/39/9696) from word embeddings. I'm also involved with the Transportation Sustainability Research Center/Caltrans doing various backend tasks for their ongoing [truckparking database project](http://www.americantruckparking.com/about-us).

In my (ever dwindling) freetime, I enjoy remaking retro games, reading, and baking.

If you have any questions/critiques/feedback for me, feel free to contact me!
